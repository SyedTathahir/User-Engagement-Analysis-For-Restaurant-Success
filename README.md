## **Analysis Overview**

### **Problem Statement**
In the competitive restaurant industry, understanding factors influencing business success is vital. This analysis focuses on user engagement metrics and their correlation with review counts and ratings.

- Assess the impact of sentiment on reviews and ratings.
- Analyze time trends in user engagement to identify sustained versus sporadic activity.

### **Hypotheses**
- Higher user engagement correlates with increased review counts and ratings.
- Positive sentiment in reviews and tips leads to higher ratings and review counts.
- Consistent user engagement over time is linked to long-term restaurant success.

### **Tools & Libraries Used**
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
- **Database Interaction**: SQLite, SQLAlchemy

# Analysis and Findings

## Key Metrics:

- Out of 150,000 businesses, 35,000 are restaurant businesses that are currently open.

   <img src="img/highesreview.png" width="300" height="300">
</div>

- **Distribution of business success metrics** (review count and average rating) highlights that:
  - Higher ratings do not guarantee a higher review count, or vice versa.
  - The success of restaurants is not solely determined by ratings or review counts.
  - Review counts reflect user engagement but not necessarily overall customer satisfaction or business performance.
---

## Do Restaurants with Higher Engagement Tend to Have Higher Ratings?
<img src="img/engagementbar.png" width="750" height="300">

- Data reveals a general increase in average reviews, check-ins, and tip counts as ratings improve from 1 to 4 stars.
- Restaurants rated 4 stars exhibit the highest engagement but show a downward trend for ratings above 4.
- The drop in engagement at 5.0 stars might suggest:
  - A saturation point where fewer customers feel compelled to add reviews.
  - Selectivity, where only a small, highly satisfied audience frequents these establishments.
---

## Correlation Between Reviews, Tips, and Check-ins

- User engagement across different platforms (reviews, tips, and check-ins) is strongly interlinked.
- Higher activity in one metric tends to drive increases in others.
- **Recommendation**: Businesses should focus on strategies that boost all types of user engagement to enhance overall visibility and customer interaction.

## Is there a difference in the user engagement between high-rated and low-rated businesses?
<img src="img/difference.png" width="400" height="200">

## Engagement Differences Between High-Rated and Low-Rated Businesses
- Data shows a clear correlation between higher ratings and increased user engagement.
- Higher-rated businesses consistently drive more reviews, tips, and check-ins.
